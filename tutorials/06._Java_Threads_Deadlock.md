# Thread contention

In previous slides, the three types of thread contention were introduced:

1. Deadlock

2. Starvation

3. Livelock

Let's see how deadlock can occur in Java.

# Create a `DeadlockMain`

```java
public class DeadlockMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String lockOne = "I'm a lock";
        String lockTwo = "I'm a lock too";

                                        // anonymous class
        Thread threadOne = new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lockOne) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 is using lock one");
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(100);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }

                    synchronized (lockTwo) {
                        System.out.println("Thread 1 is using lock two");
                    }
                }
            }
        };

        Thread threadTwo = new Thread() {
            public void run() {
                synchronized (lockTwo) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 is using lock two");

                    synchronized (lockOne) {
                        System.out.println("Thread 2 is using lock one");
                    }
                }
            }
        };

        threadOne.start();
        threadTwo.start();
    }
}
```

# Let's observe the result

*What happens and why?*

*What did we want to happen instead?*

---

# The deadlock example explained

The first thread acquires `lockOne` and then tries to acquire `lockTwo`.

The second thread acquires `lockTwo` and then tries to acquire `lockOne`.

Thread one is waiting for thread two to release `lockTwo`, and thread two is waiting for thread one to release `lockOne`.

They are both blocked indefinitely, resulting in a deadlock.
